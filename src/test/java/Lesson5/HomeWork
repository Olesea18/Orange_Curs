1)reverse of the String,use Scanner
2)Write a Java program to get the character at the given index within the string.
 3)Given a string, compute a new string where identical chars that are adjacent in the original string are separated from each other by a "*".
Examples are as shown below::
function name is public String pairStar(String str)

 pairStar("hello") → "hel*lo"
 pairStar("xxyy") → "x*xy*y"
 pairStar("aaaa") → "a*a*a*a"
 4) Given a string, compute a new string where all the lowercase 'x' chars have been moved to the end of the string.

   Examples are as shown below::
   function name is public String endX(String str)

   endX("xxre") → "rexx"
   endX("xxhixx") → "hixxxx"
   endX("xhixhix") → "hihixxx"
